		<h1><u><center>Puma Review</center></u></h1>
		<p>I don't have a lot of experience with puma because I don't really like because they don't have a wide range of styles. They are acully the smallest out of all of them. They are only worth 5.11 billion dollars. They have acully been around the longest which is a surprise because they were worth the least. They were founded in 1948. That puts them at the bottom of my list. They don't really have a big style of stuff they really only have gym stuff or walking around shoes. Puma in my opinion is the worst. They are relly behind on the style of clothes and shoes for a lot of people and I thin kthat is why they are not making that much money.<br><br> Puma was doing much better awhile ago because they didn't have a lot of competeters but know they do and that is why they are not doing as well. They don't know how to handle compatition. The other competeters do and have more in style stuff because they are newer.</p>
