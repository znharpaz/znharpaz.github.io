		<h1><u><center>Adidas Review</center></u></h1>
		<p>    Adidas has been around for a while and there signature style is the three stripes.
		 They make clothes sports products and shoes. They make a wide range of shoes from 
		 basketball and soccer shoes to just every day shoes. They also make a wide range 
		 of clothes. They are not the best companny in my opinion because they don't have a range 
		 of styles. ALmost all of there shoes have the three stripes and they don't have a lot of details or anything of that sort. They also make some good rain coats. I think there best products are 
		 there shirts because they make the big addidas logo look very cool.</p>

		 	    <p>Adidas is worth 36.59 BILLION DOLLARS!!! That is actully not that much compared to some of its other compatition. August 18, 1949, in Herzogenaurach, Germany. Adidas has grown a lot but not enough. Adidas has a wide price range in it's different lines. There
		 	    price range is very big. In two words I would all Adidas "A JOKE!!!"</p>
