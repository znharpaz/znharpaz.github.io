		<h1><u><center>Nike Review</center></u></h1>
		<p>Nike is one of the companies in sports appearal. They have lifetime deals with Michael Jordan, Lebron James and some more. They also have other types of deals for example they have a different deal with kyrie irving. They also have many many different styles and you can probably find any style you want. They also make a wide range of clothes. They make sports jerseys all the way to collard shirts. I like there airmax shoes. They are basically a shoe but the whole soule is a air bag. They are very comfortable. I also like the Kyrie shoes because they have a loy of little desiegns that are very cool. They are worth 93.36 BILLION DOLLARS!!! They were founded in January 25, 1964. There first shoes were for the oregon ducks sports team. Nike has Dri-fit clothes which are very comfortable and easy to wash. They also make a lot of clothes with that elasticy material which absorbs sweat and is very light so you can run fast. They have a head quaters in oregon. They also come out with shoes all the time so if you ever need new shoes they will have some just for you. In one word I would call Nike"AWESOME"!!!</p>
