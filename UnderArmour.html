They have many different colors and types of them. Under Armour is worth 8.3 billion dollars which makes them close to the bottom of list but they have not been around for a while. They were founded in 1996, in Washington, D.C. 
		<br><br>Under armour as you can see they have not been around for a long time and they only actully started making money when Stephen Curry signed with them. They got very lucky to sign him because nike tried but they put up the wrong presentation when he came so he left to go sign with Under Armour and that made Nike mad and Nike could have made a lot more money if they weren't careless. Under Armour was very lucky to get Stephen Curry.</p>
